# Udacity_projects
Example of projects realized through some Udacity MOOCs

- Supervised learning case : use of several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected in the US   
- Unsupervised learning case : a customer segmentation using a look-alike method (no data available)
- Image recognition : building of an image classifier predictor using Pytorch library and a transfer-learning approach
