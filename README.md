# Term 1 Udacity projects

## Introduction
I decided to follow the `Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program` because I was very eager to learn how to implement in practice end-to-end Machine Learning projects while learning coding best practices. You will find below the three projects completed during the term 1 of this program.

## Repo structure
`supervised_learning_case` - Finding Donors for CharityML:
- Details: Classification of individual income - by evaluating and optimizing several different supervised learners (Random Forest, GBM, KNN, SVM)- in order to optimize the donation yield
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn

`image_recognition` - Flower image classifier:
- Details: Building a python application to be run from the command line in order to classify flower images using transfer learning with vgg16 pre-trained model
- Technological stacks: python, argparse, pytorch, GPU resources with cuda, command line

`unsupervised_learning_case`- Customer segmentation: 
- Details: Optimization of customer outreach for a mail order company by implementing look-alike method relying on clustering algorithms, and demographic & spend data
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn

## Key takeaways :
- Learn how to implement an end-to-end Machine Learning Projects 
- Learn how to efficiently use very common Machine Learning libraries & Deep Learning such as `scikit-learn` and `pytorch`
- Learn how to build a clean code with functions and classes, and argument parsing in order to call and execute your project from a command line
